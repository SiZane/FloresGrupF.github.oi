              Unfortunately, due to poaching the Javan Rhino population has declined and now there are only a few dozen left in Ujung Kulon National Park, Banten, Indonesia.</p>
            <h6 class="infotitle">Causes of Population Decline</h6>
            <p class="card-text">Initially, the main cause of the decline in the Javan rhino population was poaching. 
              However, the biggest threat currently to the Javan Rhino is inbreeding which causes a decline in quality and weakens the rhino's ability to cope with disease or natural disasters.
              <br>
              This often happens because the rhino population only lives in a national park area that is small enough for them.</p>

              E. Obesa is an interesting plant, this plant has a round shape like a ball and has no thorns, so it is suitable for decoration.
              <br>
              This plant has a diameter of 6 – 15 cm depending on its age, and its shape even changes to become more cylindrical with age.
              <br>
              This plant has such a name because it has 8 longitudinal ribs with protrusions on the edges that make it look like a baseball.
              <br> 
              E. Obesa is almost the same as a cactus, they store water in their stems so that this plant is drought tolerant, it's just that E. Obesa doesn't have thorns like a cactus.</p>

              this plant can also survive for a very long time, even more than 1,000 years.
              <br>
              This plant is very unusual because it only consists of the base of the stem, roots and leaves full of stomata that continue to elongate with an average growth of 8-15 cm per year. 
              Although the longer it grows, the more wrinkled and withered the leaves become. Because of the wind and heat, the leaves of this plant are split so that they look many instead of two.
              <br>
              Just like the leaves, the roots of this plant grow very long, up to 30 m in search of water.</p>

              In 1957, this plant was believed to be extinct, but in 2002, someone accidentally found a plant of this species on a remote hillside which is part of the Cwm Idwal National Nature Reserve. 
              <br>
              But in fact, after disappearing for years, this plant reappeared not only one but 3.
              <br>
              In 2021, the number of these plants is likely to have doubled to six, but due to the difficulty in accessing where these plants are located, it is not certain that these plants are the mysterious Hieracium Snowdoniense species.
              <br>
              The flowers of this species are beautiful bright yellow in color, complete with a small rosette of leaves that extend at the base, growing at the end of a fine stalk covered with tiny black hairs.
              <br>
              These plants, which can grow up to ± 30 cm (12 inches), apparently also produce fruit, although not regularly, and will ripen after about one month.</p>

            <p class="card-text">After being presumed extinct for years, many experts believe the main reason for the decline in the population of this plant is due to long-term overgrazing of local sheep. 
              Fortunately, in the early 2000s, a rescue team collected seeds to plant in the National Botanic Garden of Wales. Now, the seeds have flowered in that place.</p>
